# Amazon Kinesis
> Amazon Kinesis is the AWS solution for collecting, processing, and `analyzing streaming data` in the cloud.

- `streaming data`:
  - e.g. Purchase from the online store (amazon.com), IoT Sensor Data, Stock Prices, Geospatial data (uber.com), Social Network Data (Twitter), etc.

- When you need `real-time` â‡’ Kinesis

- `Kinesis Data Streams`

  - per running shard, data can persist within the `stream`, data is `ordered` and every consumer keeps its own position.
  - Consumers have to manually added(coded)
  - Data persists for 24 hours to 168 hours.  
    - default: 24 h

- [`Kinesis Firehose`][firehose]

  - pay for only the data ingested, data immediately disappear once processed.
  - Consumer of choice is from a predefined set of services: S3, Redshift, Eleasticsearch, or Splunk.

- `Analytics`:
  - [`Kinesis Data Analytics`][data-analytics]:

    - allows you to **perform queries in real-time**.
    - Needs a Kinesis Data Streams (input) / Firehose (output).

  - `Kinesis Video Analytics`:
    - securely ingests and stores video and audio encoded data to consumers such as SageMaker, Recognition, or other services to apply Machine learning and video processing.

- You can write data to stream using AWS SDK, but KPL is more efficient
  - [`KPL(Kinesis Producer Library)`][kpl] is a Java library to write data to a stream.
