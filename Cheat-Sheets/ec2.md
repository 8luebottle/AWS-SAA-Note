# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
> Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

- [`Instances`][instances]:
  - Instance RAM must be < 150GB.
  - Instance families:
    - c3, c4, c5
    - m3, m4, m5
    - r3, r4, r5

- 4 different `price models`:
  - **On Demand**  
    Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.

  - **Reserved**  
    Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for instance.
    - Contract Terms: 1 Y or 3 Ys
  - **Spot**  
    Enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater saving if your applications have flexible start and end times.
  - **Dedicated Hosts**  
    Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

- [`Placement Groups`][placement groups]:
  - `Cluster` Placement Group:

    - Low Latency / High Network Throughput

  - `Spread` Placement Group:

    - Individual Critical EC2 Instances

  - `Partitioned` Placement Group:

    - Multiple EC2 instances HDFX, HBase, and Cassandra.

- `Hibernate`:
  - Max: 60 days
  - much faster to boot up because you do not need to reload the OS.
  - [Charge in Hibernate state][charge-in-HS] (like stopped instance)
    - Elastic IP Address.
    - EBS Volumes attached to EC2 Instance

- `Termination`:
  - **Termination Protection**:  
    - default: turned off â‡’ must turn it on.

- `Metadata`:
  - Used to get information about an instance (such as public IP)
  - GET Metadata:  
    curl `https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
  - GET Userdata:  
    curl `https://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/`
