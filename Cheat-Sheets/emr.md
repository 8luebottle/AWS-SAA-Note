  - A cluster is a `collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances`.

- [`consists of`][node types]:  

  - `Master node`: A node that manages the cluster.
    - tracks the status of task.
    - monitor the health of the cluster.
    - by default, log data is stored on the master node.

  - `Core node`: A node with software components that run tasks and store data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on your cluster.
    - managed by the master node.

  - `Task node` (optional): A node with software components that only runs tasks and does not store data in HDFS.
    - add power to perform parallel computation tasks on data.

- You can configure replication to S3 on 5 min intervals for all log data from the master node. â‡’ you have to create a cluster.
